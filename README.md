Project: DoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning

The "DoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning" project aims to enhance network security by identifying and mitigating Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks through advanced machine learning techniques. DoS attacks, which disrupt the availability of network resources by overwhelming them with excessive traffic, pose significant threats to the stability and accessibility of online services.

This project involves collecting and preprocessing network traffic data to create a dataset suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models. Various algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes, are explored to develop a robust detection system. The models are trained to distinguish between normal traffic patterns and malicious activities indicative of DoS attacks.

Key components of the project include feature selection to identify the most relevant indicators of an attack, model training and validation, and performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ultimate goal is to deploy a real-time monitoring system capable of detecting DoS attacks promptly and with high accuracy, thereby enhancing the resilience of network infrastructures against such malicious activities.
